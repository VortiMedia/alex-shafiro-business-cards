## 🎯 **Project Vision**

Create a production-ready, cost-optimized business card generation system that intelligently leverages both OpenAI GPT Image 1 and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to deliver:

- **Draft Quality**: Fast, low-cost concept exploration ($0.005/card)
- **Production Quality**: Premium results for final deliverables ($0.19/card)
- **Intelligent Selection**: Automatic model choice based on requirements
- **Cost Transparency**: Clear cost estimation and monitoring

## ✅ **Sprint 1: Architecture & Core Workflow (COMPLETE)**

### **Objectives**
- [x] Clean up outdated DALL-E references
- [x] Implement ModernHybridWorkflow class
- [x] Create enhanced CLI with intelligent model selection
- [x] Establish dual model architecture (GPT Image 1 + Gemini)

### **Deliverables Completed**
- [x] **ModernHybridWorkflow** (`src/hybrid/modern_workflow.py`)
  - Dual model support with automatic fallback
  - Quality-based model selection (draft/review/production)
  - Cost estimation and tracking
  - Comprehensive error handling
  
- [x] **Enhanced CLI** (`generate_business_cards_v2.py`)
  - Interactive menu with 9 options
  - Cost transparency before generation
  - Session cost tracking
  - Detailed result reporting

- [x] **Directory Structure**
  - `output/production/` - High-quality final cards
  - `output/drafts/` - Low-cost concept exploration
  - `src/hybrid/` - Core workflow components

### **Technical Achievements**
- **Intelligent Model Selection**: Automatically chooses best model for use case
- **Cost Optimization**: 40x cost difference between draft ($0.005) and production ($0.19)
- **Quality Tiers**: Three distinct quality levels for different use cases
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation if one API is unavailable
