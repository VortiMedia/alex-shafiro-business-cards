## Technical Architecture for V2

### Enhanced Generator Structure
```python
class BusinessCardGeneratorV2:
    def __init__(self, config_path: Optional[str] = None):
        # Enhanced initialization with config support
        pass
    
    def generate_batch(self, concepts: List[str], variations: List[str]) -> BatchResult:
        # Batch processing with progress tracking
        pass
    
    def validate_design(self, image_path: str) -> ValidationResult:
        # Quality and compliance checking
        pass
    
    def export_print_package(self, output_dir: str) -> PrintPackage:
        # Complete print-ready package generation
        pass
```

### Configuration System
```yaml
# config.yaml
brand:
  name: "Alex Shafiro PT / DPT / OCS / CSCS"
  company: "A Stronger Life"
  colors:
    primary: "#0A0A0A"
    accent: "#00C9A7"
    text: "#FAFAFA"

output:
  formats: ["PNG", "PDF", "SVG"]
  quality: "print"
  include_bleed: true
  include_guidelines: true

generation:
  batch_size: 3
  retry_attempts: 2
  quality_threshold: 0.85
```

## Development Priorities

2. Add batch generation optimization
3. Improve error handling and retry logic

### Phase 2: Output Format Expansion
1. Add PDF export capability
2. Implement CMYK conversion
3. Create print-ready package exports

### Phase 3: Customization System
1. Configuration file support
2. Template system
3. Variable data processing

### Phase 4: Professional Integration
1. Print shop API integration
2. Brand compliance validation
3. Quality assurance automation

## Success Metrics for V2

- **Generation Speed**: <30 seconds for complete 6-card set
- **Quality Consistency**: >95% first-pass success rate
- **Format Support**: PNG, PDF, SVG, TIFF
- **Batch Efficiency**: Handle 10+ variations without manual intervention
- **Print Success**: 100% compatibility with major print services

## V2 Development Notes

The v1 system provides a solid foundation. V2 should focus on professional-grade features that make the system suitable for business use, team deployment, and commercial applications while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of v1.

**Next Steps**: Choose Phase 1 features to implement first based on user needs and feedback.
